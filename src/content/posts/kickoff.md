# Techlan London 2023

With me visiting the UK for a number of weeks, Greg and I decided to do a bit of a TechLan.

We aim to kick off with getting this site up and running  using some common devops tooling, then delve deep into 
kubernetes and other cloud native patterns, including some Golang learning.

What this space for further updates as we progress
